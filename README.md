# STRMR

I'm a developer, I love music, and I love ROON. However, I don't love the price tag, so i've set out to create an open source project that will ultimately become bigger and better than ROON. This software will always be free to use and will cater to more than just the Hi-Fi community.

## Getting Started

STRMR doesn't currently do much of anything, but please contact me if you're interested in helping.
